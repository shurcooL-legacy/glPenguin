###################### Release 2


New in Release 2:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Note that in this release, there are always blocks falling at the bottom, and you can climb them as they fall. If you do this fast enough, you can win right away.

Another update is done to the config file parser: it can now accept boolean values of Yes/No/True/False/1/0, all case insensitive. Special thanks goes to DuneBoy from #C++. ;)


What you need to know:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Just run the exe, and it should tell you all that.


Everything else:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The main new addition would be the CConfig class, which allows me to read settings stored in a file. Wheee...!

Coded by shurcooL (shurcooL@hotmail.com). If you have any questions, feel free to email me. As you can tell from the version number, it's not even close to being finished. The only reason I'm releasing it now again is so that I could get it from places and show it to people, since the old versions are long gone (the place where they were hosted, anyway).

Special thanks go to Scheermesje for giving me the idea to work on this game, concept of which *has* already been done. Look into "Ice Palace" for C64 (thanks to The_Lantern for pointing this out).

Oh, also, thanks to the maker of GLFW, a quite decent window creation (and more) library, that I'm using here. Use Google to find it. :)
